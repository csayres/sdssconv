Procedure so far:


change wavelength value (units of microns)
change y-field value (units of degrees)
run Optimize
extract 'thickness' value for Surface 14 (z-location)
extract 'value' from Operand 82 (CEHY y-centroid)

optional right now: extract Huygens PSF text values


Unknown Procedure:
vary thickness (z-through focus) and extract operand value (centroid y-value) - i'm not sure how to do this without running the merit function optimization which would 'auto focus' the image.
