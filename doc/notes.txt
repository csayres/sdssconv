re: sharing models:
Hi Conor,

Chris Brandon is putting the Wok models into the PDM system for you.

Here's the equations from Solidworks used for the focal surface curvatures (The Woks are offset 143mm below the focal surface.  I generated the Woks by creating the focal surface with the equation and then offsetting the surface by 143)

DUPONT TELESCOPE FOCAL SURFACE (0.000113636363636*x^2)/(1+sqrt(1-0.0000000129132231405*x^2))+(0.0000012336318*x^2)

SLOAN TELESCOPE FOCAL SURFACE 9199.322517101522-(((9199.322517101522)^2)-x^2)^.5

I've attached a pdf showing the constructions sketch for the Sloan Wok as an example.  Dupont is the same except I use the DuPont equation for the curve.

Thanks,
Mark

email: plugplate tab direction

We don’t know about the plate tab orientation

However, the BOSS slithead you see would the the one that goes into the left-hand BOSS spectrograph on the Sloan telescope when approaching the telescope from the same direction as loading/unloading a plug-plate cartridge, and the electrical panel at right is on the side where there right-hand BOSS slithead would be in a BOSS plate cartridge.

email: plate orientation when installed on telescope

Oh, I see.  It points in the same direction as the light coming from the SP2 slithead.  The tab does not point at one of the slitheads.

So if the tab is at 6 o'clock, the SP1 slithead is at 9 o'clock and the SP2 slithead is at 3 o'clock.

### rotator angles
LCO 189.5 (roughly 0.5 degree spread)

! position of the center of the rotator in instrument frame (x,y deg)
Rot_Inst_xy        0.0010            0.0020

! angle from the instrument x axis to the rotator x axis (deg)
Rot_Inst_ang    -89.89

Hi Conor,
The rotator is limited to move between 60 and 300 degrees.
The rotation is clockwise
Quoting Povilas "looking to the north the north edge goes to the left..clockwise from the bottom”
Best,
Francesco
