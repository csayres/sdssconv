re: sharing models:
Hi Conor,

Chris Brandon is putting the Wok models into the PDM system for you.

Here's the equations from Solidworks used for the focal surface curvatures (The Woks are offset 143mm below the focal surface.  I generated the Woks by creating the focal surface with the equation and then offsetting the surface by 143)

DUPONT TELESCOPE FOCAL SURFACE (0.000113636363636*x^2)/(1+sqrt(1-0.0000000129132231405*x^2))+(0.0000012336318*x^2)

SLOAN TELESCOPE FOCAL SURFACE (9199.322517101522-(((9199.322517101522)^2)-x^2)^.5)

I've attached a pdf showing the constructions sketch for the Sloan Wok as an example.  Dupont is the same except I use the DuPont equation for the curve.

Thanks,
Mark
